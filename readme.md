# Extended Data Handling in x86_64 Assembly

This assembly code demonstrates an extended data handling example in x86_64 assembly language. 
The code includes various operations like copying, reversing, and converting strings to uppercase, all while handling memory efficiently. 
Additionally, it showcases parallel processing using threads.

## Features

1. **Copying Strings**: The code copies the "Hello, World!" string to a buffer.

2. **Reversing Strings**: It reverses the string and prints the reversed version.

3. **Uppercasing Strings**: The original string is converted to uppercase in-place and printed.

4. **Parallel Processing**: Two threads are created to work on the data simultaneously, demonstrating parallel processing.

## Prerequisites

To assemble and run this code, you'll need:

- An x86_64 compatible machine.
- NASM (Netwide Assembler) for assembly.
- A POSIX thread library for parallel processing.

## Usage

1. Assemble the code:

   ```bash
   nasm -f elf64 extended_data_handling.asm -o extended_data_handling.o
